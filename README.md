## Skills

### Languages I speak

My default settings are English (UK) and Python, but I have experience programming in R for data science and machine learning, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for web development.

I am currently developing my skills in C and C++ in order to improve my understanding of low-level programming and write more performant code.
